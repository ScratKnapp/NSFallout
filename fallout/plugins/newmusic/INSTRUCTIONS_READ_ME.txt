!!!!Audio hosted on Discord WILL NOT WORK, due to discord changing how they store and handle media!!!!


Alternative 1:
> You can use something like https://downloads.khinsider.com to use video game music (the site usually has both OST and gamerips)
> Select the audio you want, right click the audio player (the one under the "click here to download as MP3")
> Select "COPY AUDIO LINK"
> Insert that into the path bar in the plugin menu

Alternative 2:
> Upload your audio to google drive
> Right click, share, make sure anyone with link can view (public)
> Insert the link into the plugin path bar. The plugin will remake the url into something useable.
